I have been on RAGBRAI (Des Moines Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa) several times since 2005. Over the years I compiled a pretty decent packing list for both supported (bus team) and unsupported bicycle touring rides. This is what works for me. You are welcome to use it as a reference to pack for RAGBRAI, or any other bike trip.
