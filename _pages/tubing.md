        We are schedule to float at 12:30 PM, which means the whole group needs to be ready to board the bus at that time. I recommend that you arrive at the camp by 10:30 AM so you can register, setup your tent, load the coolers, lather up, crack a beer and get in on the group picture.

        This one should go without saying. If you aren't drinking during the float, you are probably not going to have much fun. This isn't the peer pressure your parents warned you about, this is just the way it is. Use your own judgement in buying booze beforehand as space in cars might be tight on the way up. Be wary of anything called a "concoction." You will end up miles downstream alone missing one shoe and have to hitch hike your way back to camp.

        Besides beer, this second most important thing you need on the float. Let me clarify an earlier point, clothing is optional during the float. I am not "saving the day" again this year by bringing extras, so remember to bring your own.

        It is rocky out there despite all the water, plus broken glass, etc. Straps provide extra traction compared to flip-flops. With that said, most of you won't take this advice and bring a cheap pair of Old Navy flip flops to minimize tan lines. I respect your decision, though I will only point and laugh as your flip flop drifts away down river... I don't recommend aqua socks, old tennis shoes or five fingers because your doggies won't breathe, and will be shriveled raisins by the time we get out of the water. Year after year, folks don't follow this advice, but by the end of the float agree that it is worth the investment and that I am the wisest man this side of the Mississippi.

        I am all for folks hunkering in other people's bunkers, and it usually works out in the end, but you should probably talk to the folks you want to sleep with ahead of time. People have also been known to sleep in cars.

        If you are bringing clothing, cash, or other items you don't to get wet down to the river, I suggest not bringing them... Or if you insist, a waterproof bag with a loop or something to latch on to. One year, all this stuff was put in the cooler... Not only was it a bitch to get a beer out, but coolers get tipped and things fall out, sink, and are lost forever. We have a basic car key that I attach to my swimsuit, so everyone else's keys can be locked in our car during the float.

        This is a goddamn brilliant idea for hooking up sandals, waterproof bags, waterproof disposable cameras, etc. They also make sunscreen with a carabiner hooked up to it! One year, sandals ended up in the cooler, which tipped. Some sandals were lost, other orphaned sandals were found, and amazingly some how, no one in the group ended up barefoot. This doesn't really make my point to bring a carabiner, but it is still a pretty neat story.

        Only 40-50 qt coolers (approx. 14”x24”) are allowed on the float. We need a couple of these based on the number of folks we got going. Let me know if you want to volunteer one. We also need a couple coolers to hold food, water, etc. for back at camp.

        Not allowed at this place. So forget your plans to build a floating island of tubes. I recommend the foot/butt method as it works well in a pinch and is a great way to bond with each other (puns intended), but they have noodle floats that work okay.. You will see the foot/butt method makes perfect sense once we are in the water and the noodles fail.

        Unfortunately, as a group, we are getting older and the young kids stay up later than we prefer. Some dicks won't pass out or fall asleep at all... Trying to reason with these assholes in the past have proved to be pointless. There is nothing that will ever de-throne booze and koozies as the most important items to bring, but earplugs come in at a close third.
