i finally had a chance to mess with jekyll a bit more and added a few features to the site:

* bootstrap css/js
* fontawesome
* archive page
* disqus comments
* google analytics
* categories/tags

feel free to checkout my [repo](https://github.com/joewhitsitt/joewhitsitt.github.io) to see how i did it all.
